# 🌍 English to French Translator (Statistical Machine Translation)

## Problem
Building language translation systems helps understand how machines learn relationships between languages.  
The goal of this project is to **translate English sentences into French** using a **Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)** approach instead of modern neural models, to demonstrate strong NLP fundamentals.

This project focuses on:
- Word alignment
- Probabilistic translation
- Classical NLP techniques

---

## Architecture (SMT Pipeline)

1. **Parallel Corpus Loading**
   - English–French aligned sentence pairs loaded from NLTK `comtrans`
   - Parallel corpus used for word-level alignment

2. **Model Training**
   - Trained **IBM Model 1**
   - Learns word-to-word translation probabilities
   - Uses Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm

3. **Translation Logic**
   - Input English sentence is tokenized
   - Each word translated using highest-probability mapping
   - Unknown words handled gracefully

4. **User Interface**
   - Gradio web interface
   - Real-time English → French translation
   - Public shareable link for demos
